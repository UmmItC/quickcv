# Quickcv

Quickcv is a modern resume builder that allows users to create beautiful and professional resumes effortlessly. Built with Solid.js and UnoCSS, it offers a sleek interface and customizable templates.

## Credit

I forked from [siduck/quickcv](https://github.com/siduck/quickcv) and continued the development since the original repository was inactive.

### What I Did

- Added new features
- Added a footer
- Added a Certifications section
- Redesigned the layout for better UI/UX and reduced spacing

## Development

To get started with Quickcv, follow these steps:
```bash
yarn install
